- Perform cross-validation for robustness.  
- Compare multiple models for best outcomes.  

**Key Metrics:**  
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- Regression: RMSE, R-squared  

---

### 7. Deployment  

Integrating the model into production systems.  
Deliver actionable results through APIs or dashboards.  

**Key Activities:**  
- Package the model for deployment (Flask, FastAPI).  
- Automate pipelines for continuous learning (MLOps).  
- Monitor performance post-deployment.  

---

### 8. Communication & Reporting  

Sharing insights with stakeholders.  
At the end of the day, the ML model must solve a problem and be properly communicated.  

**Key Activities:**  
- Create dashboards.  
- Present findings clearly and concisely.  
- Document the process and results.  

---

### 9. Maintenance & Iteration
